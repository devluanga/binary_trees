0x1D. C - Binary tree

A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node of the tree is called the root.

In C, you can represent a binary tree using a structure. Here's a basic example of a binary tree node:

```c
// Binary Tree Node
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    struct TreeNode* left;
    struct TreeNode* right;
};
```

To create a new node in the binary tree, you can use a function like this:

```c
struct TreeNode* createNode(int data) {
    struct TreeNode* newNode = (struct TreeNode*)malloc(sizeof(struct TreeNode));
    if (newNode) {
        newNode->data = data;
        newNode->left = NULL;
        newNode->right = NULL;
    }
    return newNode;
}
```

To insert a node into the binary tree, you can use a recursive function:

```c
struct TreeNode* insertNode(struct TreeNode* root, int data) {
    if (root == NULL) {
        return createNode(data);
    }

    if (data < root->data) {
        root->left = insertNode(root->left, data);
    } else if (data > root->data) {
        root->right = insertNode(root->right, data);
    }

    return root;
}
```

Remember to include the necessary headers at the beginning of your C file:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
```

This is just a basic implementation of binary trees in C. Depending on your requirements, you may need to add more functionalities, such as tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order), deleting nodes, searching, and balancing the tree.

Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science, and they find applications in various algorithms and problem-solving scenarios.s
